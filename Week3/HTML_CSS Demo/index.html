            HTML tags/elements
                Used to indicate how content should be displayed. Usually will require an opening 
                and closing
                tag, those that do not require closing tags are known as "self-closing" tags.

                <h#>        headings (range from 1 - 6, which 1 being the largest size)

                    current page

            Attributes
                    HTML elements can have attributes. Attributes provide additional information
                     about the contents
                    of an element. They appear within the opening tag of an HTML element,
                     and are made of two parts:
                    a name and a value. The name and the value are separated by an equals 
                    sign (=). The value of an
                    attribute is wrapped in double quotes ("").
