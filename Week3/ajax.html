    AJAX 
    Asynchronous JS and XML
        xml is out, JSON is in
        misleading since we use JSON instead of xml
        AJAX is not a programmint lang
        set of interactions between the XmLHttpRequest JS object in the browser and the HTML DOM
        Asynch- because HTTP request dont need to wait for eachotherto complete
            xN Periodocially reload sections of a page w/o affecting the rest
            servers process request and return responses
        AJAX workflow
        1.create/open th XmLHttpRequest(XHR) object
        2.define onreadystatechange function.
        3. open our request (xhr.open(method, url, true or false))
        4.send our request (with request body data if we want to)
            a. Send/ Pass Data -xhr.send(...);
            XmLHttpRequest (XHR) Object
            Used to exchange data with a server
            support by most modern business
            IE 5 and 6 do not support XHR
            We grab our XHR from the window object.
        Methods
            new XMLHttpRequest() - constructor 
            abort() - cancel current request
            getResponseHeader() - for response metadata (also getAll ResponseHeader() )
            open (verb, url, async,)

        XHR Properties
            onreadystatechange - defines a fx to be executed when the readystate propery changes.
            readystate - gives us the status of the XHR object. There are fice possible values, and you need to know them for life
                0 - request not initialized 
                1 - server connection est
                2 - request received 
                3 - server processing request
                4 - response is ready (status code could be anything)
                responseText - string containing the response contents
                JSON.parse(xhr.responseText)
                responseXML - for xml-formatted responses 
                status, statusText - HTTP response code and message

            Callback Function
            passed as a parameter to another function
            if we have nore than one AJAX request per page, we want to reuse our AJAX-specific
            code as much as possible. We dont want to constancyly reuse
