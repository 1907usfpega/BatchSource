<!-- DOM - Document Object Moddl
specified how browsers should create a model of an html page and how JS can access and update the contewnts of a web page while
it is in the browser window.
Structural elementw of an HTML page.
A tree of JS objects used to render the view.
Each HTML tag is a JS Object
DOM Parsing 
Loads entire page into memory
Creates tree with all tags
Can read or edit
Slow
Uses Sax Parsing

Sax Parsing 
sequential API  for XML parsing
Pulls 1 line at a time into memory
Goes sequentially through file
Cannot edit
Faster

DOM Selection and Manipulation 
How to use JS to change the look and behavior of your webpage.
To find elements, we need to use our document object. It is the object that has all of the representations of our HTML elements. We can retrieve 
elements by id name (attribute), tag names and class names (also an attribute).
document.getElementByID(id)
document.getElementsByTagName(name)
docuement.getElementByClassName(class)
Interacting with elements
[elements].innerHTML  [] not part of the notation
[elements].[attribute]
[elements].setAttribute([attribute], [value])
[elements].style
[elements].appendChild(element)
[elements].removeChild(element)
[elements].replaceChild

Navigation:
parentNode
childNodes[index]
firstChild
LastChild
previousSibling
nextSibling

Event
Some occurance in our client-side environment, which we can respond to programmability.
Types
Input events
    onfocus
    onkeypress
    etc.
Mouse events
    onmousemove
    onmouseover
    etc.
Click events

Event Object - 
    a JS representation 
3 ways of doing event listerners
Inline
    <button onclick="someFunction">HI/button>
    Couples structure and behavior unnercessarily

Method
[element].onclick = function(){....};

Long from
[element].addEventListener(type, handler, useCapture)
useCapture is an optional parameter that defaults to false.
Type: "click", "mouseover", etc. Events without "on" in front of their names.
Event handler function can (and should) be passed as a parameter. no Paranthesis

Anonymouse funtion for handler.
the event handler object is global, but we pass it in as a parameter for readability
