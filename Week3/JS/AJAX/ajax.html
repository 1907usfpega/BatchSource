    AJAX
    Asynchronous JavaScript And XML
        XML is out, JSON is in
        misleading since we use JSON instead of XML
        AJAX is not a programming language!
        set of interactions between the XmlHttpRequest JS object in the browser and the HTML DOM
        Asynchronus-because HTTP request dont need to wait for each other to complete
            can periodically reload sections of a page w/o affecting the rest
        Servers process request and return respones
    AJAX Workflow
        1.Create/Open the XmlHttpRequest (XHR) object
       2.Define onreadystatechange function.
       3. Open our request (xhr.open(method, url,true or false))
       4. Send our request (with request body data if we want to) 
        a. Send/ Pass Data -xhr.send(...);
    XmlHttpRequest (XHR) Object
        Used to exchange data with a server
        Supported by most modern businesses
        IE 5 and 6 do not support XHR
        We grab our XHR from the window object.
    Methods
        new XMLHttpRequest() - Constructor
        abort() - Cancel current request
        getResponseHeader() - for response metadata (also getAllResponseHeaders() )
        open ( verb, url, async, username, password)
            verb - HTTP method
            url - where request is going
            async - boolean, generally true. True by default.
            username and password - if your requested resource requires credentials.
    How we prepare a request.
        send (content)
        content - optional and for POST requests.
XHR Properties
    onreadystatechange - defines a function to be executed when the readystate property changes.
    readystate - gives us the status of the XHR object. There are five possible values,
     and you need to know them for life
        0 - request not initialized
        1 - server connection established
        2 - request received
        3 - server processing request
        4 - response is ready (status code could be anything)
    responseText - string containing the response contents
        JSON.parse(Xhr.responseText)
    responseXml - for XML-formatted responses
    status, statusText - for HTTP response code and message

    Callback Function
Passed as a parameter to another function
If we have more than one AJAX request per page, we want to reuse our AJAX-specific 
code as much as possible. We donâ€™t want to constantly redefine our onreadystatechange.
Define one function for XHR and a function to handle each task passed as a callback.
function ex. SendAjax( url, cFunction) {
