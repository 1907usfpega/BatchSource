  AJAX
  ASYNCHRONOUS JAVASCRIPT AND XML
      XML IS OUT, JSON IS IN
      MISLEADING SINCE WE USE JSON INSTEAD OF XML
      AJAX IS NOT A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
      SET OF INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE XmlHttpRequest JS OBJECT IN THE BROWSER AND THE HTML DOM

      ASYNCHRONOUS
      BECAUSE HTTP REQUEST DON'T NEED TO WAIT FOR EACH OTHER TO COMPLETE
        CAN PERIODICALLY RELOAD SECTIONS OF OUR PAGE WITHOUT AFFECTING THE REST OF IT.
      SERVERS PROCESS REQUESTS AND RETURN RESPONSES

      AJAX WORKFLOW
      1.) CREATE/OPEN THE XmlHttpRequest (XHR) Object.
      2.) DEFINE onreadystatechange FUNCTION.
      3.) OPEN OUR REQUEST (xhr.open(method, url, true or false))
      4.) SEND OUR REQUEST (with request body data if we want to)
        a. SEND/PASS DATA -xhr.send(...)

      XHR OBJECT
        USED TO EXCHANGE DATA WITH A SERVER
        SUPPORTED BY MOST MODERN BUSINESSES
        IE 5 AND 6 DO NOT SUPPORT XHR
        WE GRAB OUR XHR FROM THE WINDOW OBJECT.

      METHODS:
        new XmlHttpRequest() - Constructor
        abort() - Cancel current request
        getResponseHeader() - for response metadata (also getAllResponseHeaders())
        open(verb, url, async, username, password)
          verb - HTTP Method
          url - where request is going
          async - boolean, generally true. True by default.
          username and password - if requested resource requires credentials.
        How we prepare a request.
          send(content)
          content - OPTIONAL AND FOR POST REQUESTS

    XHR PROPERTIES
      onreadystatechange - DEFINES A FUNCTION TO BE EXECTURED WHEN THE READYSTATE PROPERTY CHANGES.
      readystate - GIVES US THE STATUS OF THE XHR OBJECT. THERE ARE FIVE POSSIBLE VAULUES,
      AND YOU NEED TO KNOW THEM FOR LIFE.
        0 - REQUEST CANNOT BE INITIALIZED
        1 - SERVER CONNECTION ESTABLISHED
        2 - REQUEST RECEIVED
        3 - SERVER PROCESSING REQUEST
        4 - RESPONSE IS READY (STATUS CODE COULD BE ANYTHING)

      responseText - string containing the response contents
        JSON.parse(Xhr.responseText)
      responseXml - for XML-formatted RESPONSES
      status, statusText - for HTTP resonse code and message

   CALLBACK FUNCTION
   PASSED AS A PARAMETER TO ANOTHER FUNCTION
   IF WE HAVE MORE THAN ONE AJAX REQUEST PER PAGE, WE WANT TO REUSE OUR AJAX-SPECIFIC
   CODE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. WE DON'T WANT TO CONSTANTLY REDEFINE OUR onreadystatechange.
   DEFINE ONE FUNCTION FOR XHR AND A FUNCTION TO HANDLE EACH TASK PASSED AS A CALLBACK.
