  DOM - DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL
  SPECIFIES HOW BROWSERS SHOULD CREATE A MODEL OF AN HTML PAGE AND HOW JS CAN ACCESS AND UPDATE THE CONTENTS
  OF A WEB PAGE WHILE IT IS IN THE BROWSER WINDOW.
  STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS OF AN HTML PAGE.
  A TREE OF JS OBJECTS USED TO RENDER THE VIEW.
  EACH HTML TAG IS A JS OBJECT.

  DOM PARSING
  LOADS ENTIRE PAGE INTO MEMORY
  CREATES TREE WITH ALL TAGS
  CAN READ OR EDIT
  SLOW
  USES SAX PARSON

  SAX PARSING
  SEQUENTIAL API FOR XML PARSING
  PULLS 1 LINE AT A TIME INTO MEMORY
  GOES SEQUENTIALLY THROUGH FILE
  CANNOT EDIT
  FASTER

  DOM SELECTION AND MANIPULATION
  HOW TO USE JS TO CHANGE THE LOOK AND BEHAVIOR OF YOUR WEBPAGE.
  TO FIND ELEMENTS, WE NEED TO USE OUR DOCUMENT OBJECT. IT IS THE OBJECT THAT HAS
  ALL OF THE REPRESENTATIONS OF OUR HTML ELEMENTS. WE CAN RETRIEVE ELEMENTS BY
    ID NAMES (ATTRIBUTE), TAG NAMES AND CLASS NAMES (ALSO AN ATTRIBUTE).
    document.getElementById(id)
    document.getElementByTagName(name)
    document.getElementByClassName(class)

    INTERACTING WITH ELEMENTS
    [element].innerHTML         [] not part of the notation
    [element].[attribute]
    [element].setAttribute([attribute], [value])
    [element].style

    INLINE STYLING. SINCE JAVASCRIPT IS USUALLY AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR PAGE, IT IS USUALLY THE LAST THING
    THIS ALLOWS YOU TO CONTROL ELEMENTS DYNAMICALLY, AFTER THE PAGE LOADS.

    ADDING/REMOVING ELEMENTS
    WE NEED TO USE OUR DOCUMENT AND REGISTER THE ELEMENT WITH SAID DOCUMENT.
    document.createElement()
    [element].appendChild(element)
    [element].removeChild(element)
    [element].replaceChild

    NAVIGATION:
    parentNode
    childNodes[index]
    firstChild
    lastChild
    previousSibling
    nextSibling

    EVENT
    SOME OCCURANCE IN OUR CLIENT-SIDE ENVIRONMENT, WHICH WE CAN RESPOND TO PROGRAMMATICALLY.
