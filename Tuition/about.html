	<h1>TRMS Overview</h1>
	<p>The purpose of TRMS is to provide a system that encourages
		quality knowledge growth relevant to an individual’s expertise.
		Currently, TRMS provides reimbursements for university courses,
		seminars, certification preparation classes, certifications, and
		technical training.</p>
	<h1>Business Rules</h1>
	<p>Each employee is allowed to claim up to $1000 in tuition
		reimbursement a year. The amount available to an employee is reset on
		the new year.</p>
	Event types have different standard reimbursement coverage:
	
	<pre>
                    -  University Courses 80% <br>
                    -  Seminars 60% <br>
                    -  Certification Preparation Classes 75% <br>
                    -  Certification 100% <br>
                    -  Technical Training 90% <br>
                    -  Other 30% <br>
              </pre>
	<p>
	After a BenCo has approved a reimbursement, the reimbursement is
	pending until a passing grade or presentation over the event is
	provided. The monetary amount available for an employee to reimburse is
	defined by the following equation: AvailableReimburstment =
	TotalReimburstment ($1000) – PendingReimburstments –
	AwardedReimburstments. If the projected reimbursement for an event
	exceeds the available reimbursement amount, it is adjusted to the
	amount available. Reimbursements do not cover course materials such as
	books. All Employees must complete the Tuition Reimbursement form one
	week prior to the start of the event.
	</p>
	<h1>Direct Supervisor Approval</h1>
	<p>The direct supervisor must provide approval for Tuition
		Reimbursement. The Direct Supervisor can request additional
		information from the employee before approval. If denied, the Direct
		Supervisor must provide a reason. If the direct supervisor is also a
		department head, then the department head approval is skipped. If the
		direct supervisor does not complete this task in a timely matter, the
		request is auto-approved.</p>
	<h1>Department Head Approval</h1>
	<p>The department head must provide approval for Tuition
		Reimbursement. The Department Head can request additional information
		from the employee or direct supervisor before approval. If the
		Department Head does not complete this task in a timely matter, the
		request is auto-approved.</p>
	<h1>Benefits Coordinator Approval</h1>
	<p>The BenCo must provide approval for Tuition Reimbursement. This
		stage is not skippable for any reason. The BenCo can request
		additional information from the employee, direct supervisor, or
		department head before approval. The BenCo has the ability to alter
		the reimbursement amount. If the BenCo changes the reimbursement
		amount, the Employee should be notified and given the option to cancel
		the request. If the BenCo does not approval in a timely matter, an
		escalation email should be sent to the BenCo’s direct supervisor. The
		BenCo is allowed to award an amount larger than the amount available
		for the employee. The BenCo must provide reason for this, and the
		reimbursement must be marked as exceeding available funds for
		reporting purposes.</p>
	<h1>Grade/Presentation Upload</h1>
	<p>Upon completion of the event, the employee should attach either
		the Grade or Presentation as appropriate. After upload of a grade, the
		BenCo must confirm that the grade is passing. After upload of a
		presentation, the direct manager must confirm that the presentation
		was satisfactory and presented to the appropriate parties. Upon
		confirmation, the amount is awarded to the requestor.</p>
