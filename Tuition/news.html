                    Tuition Reimbursement Programs are a Win-Win. Tuition reimbursement programs offer clear benefits to employees looking to upskill and advance. Savvy professionals<br> know they can turn their employer’s financial support into a graduate degree that will carry them the rest of their professional career.  But what’s in it for the employer?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    As with most employee benefits, they are designed to reduce turnover and attract additional qualified candidates to the organization. Many companies around the world<br> understand the value of tuition reimbursement programs and actively use it as a tool to recruit new talent.  An Accenture study found that investing in employees pays off big.<br> For every $1 a company spends on educational assistance programs, they save $1.29 in recruiting costs. Plus, by upskilling their employees, companies also have more <br>promotable staff which lowers the cost of hiring new personnel. There’s also a tax benefit to employers who offer tuition reimbursement programs.               
                    Organizations with<br> educational assistance programs also benefit from more engaged employees. Employees feel valued, knowing their employer supports their professional development,<br> which 86 percent of employees report as very important to them.

                   Beyond the Money: Other Benefits of Tuition Reimbursement Unlike other employee perks related to money (e.g., 401k plans, monetary bonuses, etc.,) tuition reimbursement<br> benefits aren’t reported on your federal income tax as income. The amount you receive in employer assistance should not be reflected on your IRS Form W-2 unless it exceeds <br>$5,250 during the tax year. And while the most apparent benefit of employee tuition reimbursement is the additional source of college funding that will help reduce your reliance<br> on student loans, some other benefits can’t be measured in dollars and cents. 
                   The completion of your graduate degree can help build your confidence in the workplace and impact <br>other parts of your life, too. Not only are you 21 percent more likely to be promoted and on the path to receiving 40 percent higher wage increases compared to co-workers who <br>pass on the opportunity, but you will also inspire those around you, showing them that, with determination and resourcefulness, what seems impossible can be achieved.
